Yolo is a deep learning algorythm which came out on may 2016 and it became quickly so popular because it’s so fast compared with the previous deep learning algorythm. With yolo we can detect real time objects at a relatively high speed. With a GPU we would be able to process over 45 frames/second while with a CPU around a frame per second.
