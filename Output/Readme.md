Yolo is a deep learning algorythm which came out on may 2016 and it became quickly so popular because itâ€™s so fast compared with the previous deep learning algorythm. With yolo we can detect real time objects at a relatively high speed. With a GPU we would be able to process over 45 frames/second while with a CPU around a frame per second.
