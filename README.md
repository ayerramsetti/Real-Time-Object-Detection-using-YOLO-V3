Building a YOLO Model for Object detection in a video
# Problem Statement
In this project we will recognize and detect different objects present in an image or video and label them to classify the objects. Some of the most sought-after research areas in computer vision applications are real-time object tracking.Despite great advances in this field, achieving significant precision and efficacy in tracking objects in real time remains a big issue.
# Overview
Real-time object tracking is at the forefront of some of the most sought-after research topics in computer vision applications. Despite tremendous progress in this area, the effectiveness and fidelity of accuracy in tracking objects in real time at a significant level remains a significant challenge. Algorithms for detection and tracking are specified in terms of extracting features from images and videos for security and scrutiny applications. Many popular algorithms are used in this area, including You Only Look Once (YOLO), Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN), and Faster RCNN (F-RCNN). Compared to all these given algorithms, RCNN gives better accuracy but coming to speed YOLO outperforms all other detection methods,including F-RCNN and R-CNN.
